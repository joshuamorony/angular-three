# Pipes

NGT provides the following pipes to help the consumers stay on the declarative side of things (aka the Template) as much as possible:

## `NgtColorPipe`

There are cases where an object's parameters/arguments require an actual instance of `THREE.Color` instead of a `THREE.ColorRepresentation`. This pipe helps with this

```html
<!-- ❌ the following usage will error out because scene.background is not a THREE.Color -->
<ngt-canvas [scene]='{ background: "black" }'></ngt-canvas>

<!-- ✅ the following will work -->
<ngt-canvas [scene]='{ background: "black" | color }'></ngt-canvas>
```

## `NgtFogPipe`

Same as `NgtColorPipe` above but for `THREE.Fog` and `THREE.FogExp`.

## `NgtVectorPipe`

Same as `NgtColorPipe` above, but for `THREE.Vector2`, `THREE.Vector3`, and `THREE.Vector4`, there are three respective pipes: `vector2`, `vector3`, and `vector4`.

## `NgtMathPipe`

This pipe acts as a helper to use the `Math` object in the template. When working with 3D scene, more often than not you will need to use the `Math` object to calculate angles and such for objects. We can do the following:

```ts
export class SomeComponent {
  // expose Math object
  MATH = Math;
}
```

or we can use `math` and `mathConst` pipes:

```html
<!-- 👇 this equals to -(Math.PI / 2) -->
<ngt-mesh [rotation]='[-(0.5 | mathConst:"PI"), 0, 0]'>
  <ngt-plane-geometry></ngt-plane-geometry>
</ngt-mesh>
```

- `mathConst`: the value passed in will be used as a multiplier. Eg: `0.5 | mathConst:'PI'` will return `Math.PI * 0.5` (or `Math.PI / 2`)
- `math`: the value passed in will be used as arguments to the `Math` object. Eg: `0.5 | math:'sin'` will return `Math.sin(0.5)`
