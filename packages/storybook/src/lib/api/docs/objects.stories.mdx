# Objects

In NGT, Objects are:

- Anything that can be added to the `Scene`, aka `THREE.Object3D`
- Non-Object3D objects like `Material`, `Geometry`, `Effect` etc...

## Usage

Any THREE.js entities can be _referenced_ by NGT with the following convention: `ngt-<kebab-case-entity-name>`. For example:

- `ngt-mesh` creates `THREE.Mesh`
- `ngt-box-geometry` creates `THREE.BoxGeometry`
- `ngt-sphere-geometry` creates `THREE.SphereGeometry`
- `ngt-mesh-basic-material` creates `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`
- `ngt-ambient-light` creates `THREE.AmbientLight`
- ...

Most, if not all, NGT objects are provided by their own Module. For example:

- `ngt-mesh` is provided by `NgtMeshModule`
- `ngt-box-geometry` is provided by `NgtBoxGeometryModule`
- `ngt-sphere-geometry` is provided by `NgtSphereGeometryModule`
- `ngt-mesh-basic-material` is provided by `NgtMeshBasicMaterialModule`
- `ngt-ambient-light` is provided by `NgtAmbientLightModule`
- ...

For THREE.js core entities, symbols that can be imported from `three`, NGT groups them under `@angular-three/core/<plural-entity-type>`. For example:

- Meshes are imported from `@angular-three/core/meshes`
- Geometries are imported from `@angular-three/core/geometries`
- Materials are imported from `@angular-three/core/materials`
- Lights are imported from `@angular-three/core/lights`
- ...

## Hierarchy

In THREE.js, many objects can add other objects as their children. For example:

```ts
group.add(mesh);
parentGroup.add(group);
scene.add(parentGroup);
```

In NGT, this happens automatically via **Content Project** and **Hierarchical Dependency Injection**.

```html
<ngt-canvas>
  <ngt-group>
    <ngt-group>
      <ngt-mesh></ngt-mesh>
    </ngt-group>
  </ngt-group>
</ngt-canvas>
```

This pseudo-template is pretty much the equivalent of the THREE.js counterpart. Via Angular DI, NGT allows these objects to provide themselves as values for a common [InjectionToken](https://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken). Hence, the objects can inject the parent object as an `Optional` dependency.

```ts
export class NgtPseudoObject3D {
  constructor(@Optional() private parentObject3d: NgtPseudoObject3D) {}
}
```

If `parentObject3d` is available, then NGT will add the object to the parent object. This behavior is driven by two properties on each NGT object: `appendTo` and `appendMode`.

| Property   | Description                                          | Default     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| appendTo   | a `THREE.Object3D` instance to append the object to. | `undefined` |
| appendMode | "none", "immediate", "root"                          | "immediate" |

- If `appendTo` is provided, then `appendMode` is skipped.
- If `appendMode` is `root`, then the object is appended to the Scene.
- If `appendMode` is `none`, then the object will not be added to the graph scene.

## How to reference NGT objects in component code?

There are two approaches to reference NGT objects in component code:

- `ViewChild`
- Template Variable via `exportAs`

Let's take a look at both approach:

#### `ViewChild`

All NGT objects are mostly Directives, sometimes Components, and they are used on the template like any other component/directive. Hence, we can leverage `ViewChild` to reference them in our component code

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: ` <ngt-mesh></ngt-mesh> `,
})
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild(NgtMeshDirective, { static: true }) mesh: NgtMeshDirective;
}
```

#### Template Variable

All NGT directives (components does not need `exportAs`) are exposed on the template via `exportAs` so we can assign a Template Variable to them. Most NGT objects have `(ready)` event which we can leverage to assign the object as soon as they are constructed and ready.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh #ngtMesh="ngtMesh" (ready)="mesh = ngtMesh.mesh"></ngt-mesh>
  `,
})
export class MyComponent {
  mesh: THREE.Mesh;
}
```

`exportAs` will always be `camelCase` with `ngt-` prefix. Eg: `ngt-mesh` is exported as `ngtMesh`, `ngt-ambient-light` is exported as `ngtAmbientLight`.

> Using Template Variable + `(ready)` is recommended because it is guaranteed that the underline THREE entity has been constructed.

## How to put existing objects in the Angular component tree?

More often than not, we want load 3D models from an external source and put them on the scene so that we can interact with them in the similar manner to other objects that NGT supports. In these cases, NGT provides a `ngt-primitive` directive that can be used to create a primitive object from an existing THREE.js object.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'some',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngIf="model$ | async as model">
                    <!-- ðŸ‘‡ NgtPrimitive exposes this object instead of itself like a NgtMesh -->
      <ngt-primitive [object]="model.scene"></ng-primitive>
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class SomeComponent {
  model$ = this.loaderService.use(GLTFLoader, 'path/to/model.gltf');

  constructor(private loaderService: NgtLoaderService) {}
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgtPrimitiveModule],
})
export class SomeComponentModule {}
```

> `ngt-primitive`, like any other 3D object, is still a 3D object and still needs to be put inside of `ngt-canvas`
